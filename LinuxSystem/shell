ls -a - will display hidden files
. indicates a file is hidden

non login - The ~/.profile file can be read by non login users, called like that because we are already logged in to our GUI Desktop. if i'll access my account using SSH i would need to login with my account and password. 
non login shell parameters are contolled by files in the home directory like /home/eran/.profile

Linux is mostly read and write files. commands and object names are case sensitive. 

all Shell variables can be displayed using the "env" command:
	-SHELL=/bin/bash - USER=eran, Path=key directories i can execute commands and access file from anywhere in the system
 (env | less - one screen at a time).
create new variable and assign:
myval=eight
echo myval
bash - creating a new bash
echo myval - won't work
exit
echo myval - now it will work
if i want to export the variable to all child Shells that might be created i can use the "export command" and the "myval" example will appear everywhere.
export myval
echo myval

when pressing "up arrow" it reads my previous commands from the ".bash_history" file with recent 1000 commands
