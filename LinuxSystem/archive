.tar is a tar archive
gz - compressed using the gzip algorithm
to unpack we run:
tar xzf file.tar.gz
x - we want to extract the files from the archive
z - it's compressed or zipped
f - file, means the file name will appear after

to pack:
tar czf namearchiver.tar.gz folder
c - create
z and f like in unpack
the "folder" that comes after tells it that we want to pack that folder inside

data corruption - happens alot, need to check my archives i created

can create archive directly by:
tar cf
    ^ no z - means no compression
then need to execute gzip or bzip to compress it 
some things i'll download will be zipped and i get use the zip command after downloading it
