-Your key has been generated.
-If you want to create a new key with more information, you should issue the command:
 $ gpg --full-generate-key

## How to export your keys
You might find yourself needing a keypair in the .asc file format. Should that be the case, you can export your private key from the command line. To do that, go back to the terminal window and locate the key you want to export with the command:
 $ gpg --list-secret-keys
You should see a list of all of your secret keys. Associated with each listing will be a key ID (a long string of random characters). Copy that string down and then issue the command:

 $ gpg --export-secret-keys ID > my-private-key.asc

To export your public key, issue the command:
 $ gpg --armor --export ID > my-pubkey.asc
The above key will export the public key into an asc file. You can then share that public key with whoever requires it.

In GIT.com:
Go to Settings, then "SSH and GPG keys", Press on "Add new GPG Key" and use what i got in the export, with the beginning and end.
