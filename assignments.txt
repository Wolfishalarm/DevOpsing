  delete everything - 03-delete-everything.sh
- Commit everything to GIT

  - Refactor gcloud scripts, remove any and all hard-coded values. 
      Except for instance create (too many)
  - When running delete script, don't ask for confirmations.
  - Learn to easily switch between gcloud projects.
  - Take a work problem (gsutil?) that we can iterate on for IR.
      Try to understand the full idea of what you want the script to do.
      - start a new file, with the details, notes, etc.
        IR.md file with details

# Thu Jun 11 20:57:23 IDT 2020
  - Understand storage project usage (there seem like too many projects)
    - Understand what we want to do when we have a new release
      Example:
        - create project
          - create bucket
            - add diretories
            - add files..

## Future assignment ideas
  - Add case statements to delete script, for options to just run 
    a single function, based on commandline options.

      $ ./delete-everything --firewall

BONUS Assignment (after all the above is working):
- Create two subnets, then create a single VM on each subnet 
  and see if you can ping each other.
