DNS is simply a database that links meaningful names (known as host names), such as http://www.microsoft.com, to a specific IP address, such as 192.168.124.1. Simply linking addresses to names is just the beginning, though, because DNS has many more features in addition to host-name-to-address mapping.

A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records, such as address (A, AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX) records for a domain name (see also List of DNS record types) and responds with answers to queries against its database.

The /etc/resolv. conf is resolver configuration file for Linux and UNIX like operating systems. It is used to configure dns name servers.
