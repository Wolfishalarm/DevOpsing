BASH Scripting:
-Nano(just a shitty text editor) myscript.sh  - sh identifies it as a script
-Shebang line - #!/bin/bash - this consist with interpeter I’m gonna use. The shebang line is the absolute location of the interpreter binary file(bash).
myscript.sh example:
------------------------
#!/bin/bash
declare -I number1
declare -I number2
declare -I total
echo “What’s your favorite number? “
		read number1
echo “What’s your most hated number? “
		read number2
total=$number1*$number2
		echo “Aha! They equal “ $total
exit 0
------------------------
0 at the end indicates success
-I = integer(supposed to be Lower case)
