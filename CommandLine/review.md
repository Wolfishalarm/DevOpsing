## Review

### a script must be set to executable before it can be run 
```
  $ chmod +x myscript.sh
```

### script will begin with "Shebang" line to identify its shell
```
  $ #!/bin/bash
```

### must decalre variables as integers 
```
  $ declare -i number1
```

### read will prompt a user for input and read the input into a variable 
```
  $ read mumber1
```

### to use an existing variable you need to preface(introduce) it with a $. 
```
  $ total=$number1**$number2
```

### for can be 
```
  $ for -i in {0..10..2}
```

###
```
  $
```
